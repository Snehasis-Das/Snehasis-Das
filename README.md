# 👋 Hi, I'm Snehasis Das

I’m a **systems-focused developer** with strong interests in **C++, graphics programming, AI/ML, and software architecture**.  
I enjoy building things **from scratch** — engines, frameworks, pipelines — to deeply understand *how systems actually work*.

This GitHub is a living record of my learning, experiments, and projects.

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- **C++ & Systems Programming**
  - Memory management, STL, data structures
  - Engine-style architecture and reusable modules

- **Graphics & Game Engine Development**
  - OpenGL (custom loaders, terrain systems, entity systems)
  - Math-heavy rendering concepts (transforms, camera, shading)
  - Performance-aware design (culling, chunking, resource sharing)

- **Desktop Applications (Qt / C++)**
  - Multithreaded Qt apps
  - Networking, custom widgets, painting, model-view architecture
  - Clean separation of UI and backend logic

- **AI / Machine Learning**
  - CNNs, RNNs, Autoencoders (TensorFlow / PyTorch)
  - ML pipelines, experimentation, and evaluation
  - Applied AI for security, analytics, and automation

- **Problem Solving & DSA**
  - Structured DSA practice for placements & LeetCode
  - Writing reusable algorithmic building blocks in C++

## 🚀 Current Goals

- Master **Data Structures & Algorithms** in C++ (placement-ready)
- Build **engine-level systems**, not just apps
- Design **scalable AI-backed software platforms**
- Strengthen fundamentals in **math, security, and software architecture**

## 📂 Repositories You’ll Find Here

- 🧩 **DSA Practice** – Structured C++ implementations of core algorithms  
- 🎮 **Graphics / Engine Experiments** – OpenGL-based systems and tools  
- 🖥️ **Qt Applications** – Desktop apps with real-world features  
- 🤖 **AI/ML Projects** – End-to-end ML pipelines and experiments  
- 🧪 **Explorations** – Concepts, prototypes, and learning sandboxes  

Each repository focuses on **learning depth**, not just final output.

## 📈 Philosophy

> “Understand the fundamentals so deeply that tools become optional.”

I prefer **clarity over cleverness**, **architecture over hacks**, and **learning over shortcuts**.
